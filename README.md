# Git Lab Exercise

## Introduction
I documented each step I took below: 

### Step 1: Creating a Local Repository
- I've opened my terminal and navigated to the desired directory using `cd` command.
- Created a folder with the name of the repository.
- Entered the new folder.
- Initialized the git repository with `git init`.

### Step 2: Uploading the Repository to GitHub
- I've created a new repository on GitHub.
- Copied the HTTPS URL of the new repository.
- Connected my local repository with GitHub.
- Ensured the connection was ok.

### Step 3: Change, Commit, and Push
- I've created a file README.md in the repository folder.
- Added the file to the staged changes with `git add` command.
- Committed the changes with `git commit -m "commit message"`.
- Pushed the changes to GitHub with `git push`.

### Step 4: Creating a Branch
- I've created a new branch named "development" with `git branch`.
- Switched to the new branch with `git checkout branch-name`.
- Made some changes to the file README.
- Added and committed the changes on the "development" branch.
- Pushed the branch and changes to GitHub.

### Step 5: Merging
- I've returned to the "main" branch with `git checkout`.
- Merged the "development" branch into the "main" branch with `git merge development`.
- Pushed the changes to the GitHub repository.
